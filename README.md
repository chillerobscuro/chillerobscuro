## Hi, I'm Logan :penguin:

I'm a Data Scientist and I've spent the last 8 years making and improving products :sparkles: in both start ups and large companies :factory:

Most of the time I'm working on Time Series Data from sensors. Check out my projects that [plot air quality over time](https://github.com/chillerobscuro/air-plots) or [stream it on your own hardware.](https://github.com/chillerobscuro/air-stream) 

I also have projects which I use as playgrounds to [combine image and text data in deep learning models](https://github.com/chillerobscuro/image-tabular-sandbox) and send myself [the best duck pictures from reddit](https://github.com/chillerobscuro/solicited-duck-pic).
  
Outside of work, I contribute to the open source [sktime library](https://github.com/sktime/sktime) which enables Machine Learning for Time Series.

Reach out and say hi at duffy.logan at gmail, or on [linkedin here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganduffy)!
